A great way to stay in touch with your relatives, by sending both SMS and MMS messages. The app properly handles group messaging too, just like blocking numbers from Android 7+.

It offers many date formats to choose from, to make you feel comfortable at using it. You can toggle between 12 and 24 hours time format too.

It has a really tiny app size compared to the competition, making it really fast to download.
